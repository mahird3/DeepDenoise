DeepDenoise: Enhancing TV Denoising with Deep Learning

This project explores and compares two image denoising techniques: Total Variation (TV) Denoising and the deep learning-based DnCNN model. The inspiration for this project came from my coursework, where we used the Total Variation method to learn about the Barzilai-Borwein optimization algorithm. This gradient-based method improves upon Cauchy's classical steepest-descent method, which often suffers from slow convergence. Instead of calculating the costly Hessian matrix, the Barzilai-Borwein method approximates the quasi-Newton approach by estimating the Hessian using scalar step sizes derived from finite differences between two consecutive gradient evaluations. This approach, which only requires gradient calculations, achieves a first-order approximation that accelerates convergence and avoids the complexity of full Newton’s methods. To demonstrate the power of this optimization approach, we applied it to image denoising in class.

Curious about improving these results, I explored how deep neural networks could be used for image denoising. This led me to the paper "Beyond a Gaussian Denoiser: Residual Learning of Deep CNN for Image Denoising" by Kai Zhang et al., which proposes a DnCNN model that learns to separate noise from image content through residual learning. In this project, I implemented the DnCNN model and compared its denoising results with those from the Total Variation approach.
