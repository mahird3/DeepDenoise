DeepDenoise: Comparing TV Denoising and Deep Learning for Image Denoising

This project explores and compares two image denoising techniques: Total Variation (TV) Denoising and the deep learning-based DnCNN model. The inspiration for this project came from my coursework, where we used the Total Variation method to learn about the Barzilai-Borwein optimization algorithm. This gradient-based method improves upon Cauchy's classical steepest-descent method, which often suffers from slow convergence. Instead of calculating the costly Hessian matrix, the Barzilai-Borwein method approximates the quasi-Newton approach by estimating the Hessian using scalar step sizes derived from finite differences between two consecutive gradient evaluations. This allows for faster convergence without the complexity of full Newtonâ€™s methods. We applied this optimization method to image denoising as part of the course.

With an interest in improving the denoising results obtained from Total Variation, I explored how deep neural networks could be applied to this task. This led me to the paper "Beyond a Gaussian Denoiser: Residual Learning of Deep CNN for Image Denoising" by Kai Zhang et al., which proposes a DnCNN model that learns to separate noise from image content through residual learning. In this project, I implemented the DnCNN model and compared its denoising results with those from the Total Variation approach.
